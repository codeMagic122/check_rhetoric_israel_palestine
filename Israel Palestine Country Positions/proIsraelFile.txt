the Assembly will hear statement by His Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu Prime Minister Minister for Foreign Affairs Minister for the economy Minister for communications and Minister for regional cooperation of the State of Israel may I request protocol to escort His Excellency I prayed the pleasure in welcoming the Prime Minister of Israel I invite him to address the General Assembly Applause distinguished delegates ladies and gentlemen when I spoke here three years ago Israel stood alone among the nations of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this hall only Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with Iran we oppose it because it threatens our future even our very survival we opposed it because the deal paved Iran's path to a nuclear arsenal and by lifting the sanctions it's fueled Iran's campaign of carnage and conquest throughout the Middle East we oppose it we oppose it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie that Iran is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons now Israel exposed that lie earlier this year last February Israel conducted a daring raid on Iran's secret atomic archive we obtained over 100,000 documents and videos that had been stashed in vaults in an innocent-looking building in the heart of Tehran in May I presented a short summary of what we obtained to the international media I provided hard evidence of Iran's plans to build nuclear weapons and its plans to deceive the international community Israel shared this information and even more damning evidence that we found with members of the p5 plus one and with the International Atomic Energy Agency months have passed the IAEA has still not taken any action it has not posed a single question to Iran it is not demanded to inspect a single new site discovered in that secret archive so given this inaction I decided to reveal today something else that we have shared with the IAEA and with a few intelligence agencies what I'm about to say has not been shared publicly before today and the disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran's secret nuclear weapons program in May we exposed the site of Iran's secret atomic archives right here in the shore Abad district of Tehran today I'm revealing the site of a second facility Iran's secret atomic warehouse it's right here in the tuc√°n Abad district of Tehran just three miles away let me show you exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like here it is you see like the atomic archive it's another innocent looking compound now for those of you at home using Google Earth this no longer secret atomic warehouse is on Mario Ali Mar Street you have the coordinates you can try to get there and for those of you who try to get there it's 100 meters from the color showy the rug cleaning operation by the way I hear they do a fantastic job cleaning rugs there but by now they may be radioactive rugs this is the second secret site now countries with satellite capabilities may notice some increased activity on Meir Ali in the days and weeks ahead the people they'll see scurrying back and forth are Iranian officials desperately trying to finish the job of cleaning up that site because you see since we raided the atomic archive they've been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse just last month they removed 15 kilograms of radioactive material you know what they did with it that 15 kilograms of radioactive material they had to get it out of the site so they took it out and they spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the evidence the endangered residents of Tehran may want to know that they can get a Geiger counter on Amazon for only $29.99 as of today that's just four million Iranian rial but we'll get to that later I'll talk about the Iranian economy in a minute they took this radioactive material and spread it around to Iran now the Iranian officials cleaning out that site still have a lot of work to do because they've had at least at least 15 ship containers they're gigantic 15 ship containers full of nuclear related equipment and materials stored there now since each of those containers can hold 20 tons of material this means that this site contained as much as 300 tons 300 tons of nuclear related equipment and material right here so distinguished delegates you have to ask yourself a question why did he Iran keep a secret atomic archive and a secret atomic warehouse because after all when South Africa in Libya when they gave up their nuclear programs the first thing they did was to destroy both the archives and the material and equipment and the answer to the question is simple the reason Iran didn't destroy its atomic archive and it's atomic warehouse is because it hasn't abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons in fact it planned to use both of these sites in a few years when the time would be right to break out - the atom bomb but ladies and gentlemen rest assured that won't happen it won't happen because what Iran hides Israel will find ladies and gentlemen I have a message to the head of the IAEA mr. Yukiya Amano I believe he's a good man I believe he wants to do the right thing well mr. Amano do the right thing go inspect this atomic warehouse immediately before the Iranians finished clearing it out distinguished delegates you remember when we were promised that inspections could take place anytime anywhere remember that anytime anywhere well how about inspections right here right now Applause and mr. Amano while you're at it inspect the other sites we told you about once and for all tell the world the truth about Iran now I also have a message today for the tyrants of Tehran Israel knows what you're doing and Israel knows where you're doing it Israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons not now not in 10 years not ever Applause and Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran's aggression we will continue to act against you in Syria we will act against you in Lebanon we will act against you in Iraq we will act against you whenever and wherever we must act to defend our state and to defend our people Applause distinguished delegates three years ago a few weeks after the nuclear deal was completed I asked this question from this very podium does anyone seriously believe that flooding Iran's radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression but many of the deal supporters believed just that they believed that Iran's regime would become more moderate more peaceful they believed that Iran would use the billions of dollars it received in sanctions relief to improve the lives of its people to solve the water problem to solve the trucking problem to solve the electricity problem hospitals schools that's what they believe perhaps many of you also believe that well this didn't happen instead Iran used the money to fuel its vast war machine just as past year Iran is attacked Kurds in Iraq slaughtered Sunnis in Syria armed Hezbollah in Lebanon financed Hamas in Gaza fired missiles into Saudi Arabia and threatened freedom of navigation in the Straits of Hormuz and the Strait of bab-el-mandeb some peace some moderation now if you think if you think that Iran's aggression has been confined to the Middle East think again last month two Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks right here in the United States and several weeks ago the Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks in the heart of Europe yet while the United States is confronting Iran with new sanctions Europe and others are appeasing Iran but trying to help it bypass those new sanctions now I've just used a word a tough word a very strong word appeasement and I use it reluctantly but unfortunately that's exactly what we're seeing again in Europe think about this the same week Iran was caught red-handed trying to murder European citizens European leaders were rolling out the red carpet for president rouhani promising to give Iran even more money I'm a historian son I have to ask I asked it not merely as a historian son I ask it as a Jew as a citizen of the world as someone who's lived through the 20th century have these European leaders learned nothing from history will they ever wake up well we in Israel we don't need a wake-up call because Iran threatens us every day because despite the best hopes and there were many hopes around the nuclear deal this deal did not push war further away it brought war ever closer to our borders in Syria Iran is trying to establish permanent military bases against us and has already launched missiles and drones into our territory in Gaza Iran is arming terror groups to launch rocket attacks into our cities and terror attacks against our civilians in Lebanon in Lebanon Iran is directing Hezbollah to build secret sites to convert inaccurate projectiles into precision guided missiles missiles that can target deep inside Israel within an accuracy of 10 metres Hizballah listen to this Hezbollah is deliberately using the innocent people of Beirut as human shields they've placed three of these missile conversion sites along Beirut's International Airport here's a picture that's worth a thousand missiles here's Beirut International Airport here's the first missile site it's in the OSI neighborhood on the water's edge a few blocks away from the runway here's the second site it's underneath a soccer stadium that's the soccer stadium two blocks away and here's the third site it's adjacent to the airport itself right next to it so I have a message for Hezbollah today Israel knows Israel also knows what you're doing Israel knows where you're doing it and Israel will not let you get away with it Applause ladies and gentlemen just as the nuclear deal supporters were wrong about what would happen when sanctions would be removed they were wrong dead wrong about what would happen when sanctions would be restored they argued that US sanctions alone would have little impact little economic impact on Iran that's what they said really well let's see what happened to Iran's economy now that President Trump has forced companies to choose between doing business with Iran and doing business with the United States whose GDP is 50 times the size of Iran's GDP a year ago Iran's economy was booming now it's collapsing Iran's currency is plummeting inflation and unemployment are soaring British Airlines German banks French oil companies Japanese all importers and many others are scrambling to get out if that's little economic impact imagine what will happen with the next batch of US sanctions imposed in November the deals supporters were also wrong when they argued you have to believe that they argue this I mean I had many arguments with them they also argued that removing sanctions story that restoring sanctions would rally the Iranian people around the regime well they're definitely rallied but not around the regime they're rallying against the regime they're not chanting death to America they're chanting death to the dictator they're not chanting export their Islamic Revolution they're chanting leave Syria leave Lebanon leave Gaza take care of us in Iran I listen to these protests I talk to the Iranian people I show these videos and I get so many responses some Iranians at first I thought these are Iranian exiles in the safety of London or Paris or Los Angeles now Iranians from Iran embracing Israel criticizing their regime that's an understatement with their names and I asked my intelligence people what's going on and shortly after the protests broke out not because of what I said but it was an indicator of something extraordinary that was taking place there because in these protests the Iranian people are showing unbelievable courage from the urban centers to the outlying villages and it's embracing now the whole of Iran from the striking Bazaar merchants to the young women uncovering their hair the people of Iran are bravely standing up to a regime that is brutally repressed them for four decades and that is squandered their money still squanders their money and bloody wars across the Middle East so here's what I say to Europe's leaders and to others instead of coddling Iran's dictators join the US and Israel and most of the Arab world in supporting new sanctions against the regime that endangers all of us and all of the world Israel is deeply grateful to president Trump for his bold decision to withdraw from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran many many of our Arab neighbors are also grateful and everyone who cares about the peace and security of the world should also be grateful but ladies and gentlemen I have an important confession to make this may surprise you but I have to admit that the Iran deal has had one positive consequence an unintended one but a positive consequence by empowering Iran it brought Israel and many Arab states closer together than ever before closer together than ever before in an intimacy and friendship that have not seen in my lifetime and would have been unimaginable a few years ago Applause and you know when you form friendships around a threat around a challenge you quickly see opportunities not only for security but how to bring the better life for our people which Israel can help and wants to help do Israel deeply values these new friendships and I hope the day will soon arrive when Israel will be able to expand peace a formal peace beyond Egypt in Jordan to other Arab neighbors including the Palestinians I look forward to working with President Trump and his peace team to achieve that goal I also want to use this opportunity we're here at the UN place I know because I served here as ambassador many years ago for many years so I know something about the UN so I want to use this opportunity to express Israel's appreciation to President Trump and ambassador Haley for the unwavering support they've provided Israel at the United Nations Applause they have unequivocally backed Israel's right to defend itself they rightly pulled out of a history denying UNESCO in a morally bankrupt UN Human Rights councils they have more resolutions about Israel than the rest of the world combined I think and tenfold compared to I don't know Iran Syria you name not even ten fold because you can't multiply zero by any number they stopped funding President Trump and ambassador Halley they stopped funding an unreformed Unruh an organization that instead of solving the Palestinian refugee problem perpetuates it day after day the Trump administration is stood up to what has long been a specialty here at the UN slandering Israel even though the shameful resolution comparing Zionism to racism was repealed 25 years ago I'm sorry to say that it's foul stench still clings to these halls Israel airlifted Ethiopian Jews to freedom and a new life in Israel in the Jewish state yet here at the UN here at the UN Israel is absurdly accused of racism Israel's Arab citizens vote in our elections serve in our Parliament preside over our courts and have exactly the same individual rights as all other Israeli citizens yet here at the UN Israel is shamefully accused of apartheid today there are at least five times as many Palestinians as there were in 1948 the year of Israel's founding yet here at the UN Israel is outrageously accused of ethnic cleansing ladies and gentlemen you know what this is it's the same old anti-semitism with a brand new face that's all it is Applause once it was the Jewish people that were slandered and held to a different standard today it's the Jewish state that is slandered and held to a different standard here's an example take the outlandish attacks that have been leveled against Israel after our Knesset our Parliament recently adopted a law declaring Israel the nation-state of the Jewish people mind you Israel is a free country you can you can oppose this law and people did you can call for different wording and this or that Clause or you can call to add or subtract a clause you can do that but when Israel is called races Israel is called races for making Hebrew its official language and the Star of David its national flag when Israel is labeled an apartheid state for declaring itself the nation-state of the Jewish people this is downright preposterous and you know why because represented in this Hall today are more than 100 countries that have only one official language even though many other languages are commonly spoken within those countries there are more than 50 countries here that have crosses or crescents on their flags even though many have non-muslims and non-christians many of them living in their midst and there are dozens of countries that define themselves as nation states of a particular people even though there are many ethnic and national minorities within their borders none of these countries are denigrated or libeled for celebrating very national identity only Israel is denigrated only Israel is libeled what is unique about the Jewish people is not that we have a nation-state what is unique is that many still opposes having a nation-states moments ago President Abbas outrageously R graciously said that Israel's nation state law proves that Israel is a racist apartheid State President Abbas you should know better you wrote a dissertation denying the Holocaust your Palestinian Authority imposes death sentences and Palestinians for selling land to Jews did you hear that if a Jew buys an apartment a piece of land anywhere in the Palestinian territories the Palestinian who sold them that land is executed that's what the law says President Abbas you proudly pay Palestinian terrorists who murder Jews in fact the more they slay the more you pay that's in their law - and you condemn Israel's morality you call Israel racist this is not the way to peace this is not the way to achieve the peace we all want and need and to which Israel remains committed this body should not be applauding the head of a regime that pays terrorists the UN should condemn such a despicable policy and the UN the UN which brokered a ceasefire in 2014 should demand that Hamas release our fallen soldiers who own shell and a dark golden who was kidnapped when Hamas violated that very ceasefire Hamas should also release the two Israeli citizens it holds captive a Barrowman gusto and Hisham a scientist ladies and gentlemen every time I stand here I feel as I do today I am privileged to stand here is the Prime Minister of the Jewish and democratic state of Israel some believe that Israel cannot be both Jewish and democratic this is false Israel is both and Israel will always remain both ever since Abraham and Sarah made their journey to the promised land nearly 4000 years ago the Land of Israel has been our homeland it's the place where Isaac and Rebekah Jacob Leah and Rachel carried on their eternal covenant with God it is where Joshua made us a sovereign nation where David ruled and Isaiah preached where the Maccabees fought and where Masada fell it's the place from which we were exiled and to which we returned rebuilding our ancient and eternal capital Jerusalem Applause the nation-state of Israel is the only place where the Jewish people proudly exercise our collective right of self-determination that right was recognized nearly a century ago by the League of Nations and over 70 years ago by the United Nations when it voted to establish or rather to support the establishment of a Jewish state that's what it said that resolution a Jewish state at the same time Israel is a vibrant democracy where all its citizens Jews and non-jews alike enjoy equal individual rights and these rights are guaranteed by law in Israel whether you're a Jew or an Arab a Christian or a Muslim a Druze or a Bedouin or anything else your individual rights are exactly the same and they will always remain the same in the middle-east that's not obvious now that's an understatement in the Middle East where women are often treated as property minorities are persecuted gays are hanged Israel stands out as a shining example of freedom and progress ladies and gentlemen I could not be more proud to represent my country Israel I'm proud that we've made Israel a global technological power of breathtaking creativity in information technology in precision agriculture you know what that is we target the fertilizer and the water down to the individual plant not field not part of a field down to the plant I'm proud of these geniuses that bring these unbelievable developments in water management's in cybersecurity in autonomous vehicles in digital health in medical devices and in so many other fields that are improving the lives of billions of people around the world I'm proud of Israel's brilliant scholars innovative entrepreneurs talented artists I'm proud of Israel's devoted teachers compassionate doctors in our search and rescue teams who save lives from Haiti to Mexico from Nepal to the Philippines I am proud I'm so proud of Israel's courageous soldiers the men and women who bravely defend our homeland while upholding the highest values Applause and most of all ladies and gentlemen most of all I am proud of the people of Israel who draw extraordinary strength from the deep well springs of our heritage who possess an unbreakable spirit and who are determined as ever to build a secure and magnificent future for the one and only Jewish state thank you Applause on the alpha of the General Assembly I wish to thank the prime minister of the State of Israel his Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu for the statement just made and I request protocol to ask for his Excellency Applause Madam President I rise today to give thanks and celebration for the United States's embassy established in the city of Jerusalem and for the continued safety and security of the Jewish people in Israel and across the world almost exactly 70 years ago Israel's founding father David ben-gurion brought together members the Jewish People's Council in the Tel Aviv Museum to declare the founding of the modern State of Israel eleven minutes later President Harry Truman courageously recognized the State of Israel over the objections of many of his advisers and the State Department and the fates of our two countries had been intertwined ever since until this week when the US Embassy was finally finally finally moved to Jerusalem recognizing that it is the eternal capital of the Jewish people and the undivided capital of Israel I was proud to have traveled to Jerusalem along with my fellow senators for the official opening of the new embassy it was an incredible honor to witness history unfolding a joyous moment for Israelis for Americans a moment of history I had the opportunity to visit with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the incredible significance of ending the 70 years of discrimination that Israel had faced no other country on earth did America have our embassy in a city other than its capital city it was only Israel where our embassy was not in the capital and I would note that for many years presidents of both parties Democrats and publicans have campaigned promising that they would move the embassy to Jerusalem which is the capital of the nation and yet presidents of both parties have failed to do so I commend President Trump for honoring that campaign commitment for delivering on that campaign commitment moving our embassy to Jerusalem is an acknowledgment of undeniable truth that Jerusalem is in fact the capital of the nation of Israel it is where we find the Knesset is where we find the Supreme Court it is where we find the Prime Minister it is where we find the president of Israel it is the capital city and now our embassy reflects that fact but moving the embassy and recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has significance beyond that it has significance because it is an unmistakable message to our friends and to our enemies that the United States stands with our friends and stands unshakably alongside the nation of Israel there was considerable debate within the administration about if and when to move the embassy that's been true in Prior administration's as well considerable debate and the principal argument against moving the embassy has always been that the enemies of Israel wouldn't like it well that I believe is yet another reason why this was the right thing to do there were some who made the case that moving the embassy would diminish the chances of peace in the Middle East now I'll confess I am skeptical that peace will be attained any time soon I don't believe the impediment to peace in the Middle East is the nation of Israel Israel wants peace it is Israeli babies who are being murdered by the terrorists the barrier to peace I don't believe we will see peace in the Middle East unless and until the Palestinian leadership number one acknowledges Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state and number two renounces terrorists as long as the Palestinian leaders are engaged in a unity government with Hamas on a vowed terrorist organization seeking to destroy the nation of Israel and murder innocent Israelis peace will not be hand but what I urged president trumpet and urged the administration is that moving the embassy increases I believe the chance of peace why is that because it demonstrates that America stands strong stands by our friends and is not shaken is not buffeted by global media opinion I suggested to the administration that our Arab allies in the region they publicly would denounce them if they would have to for domestic political concerns however I believe privately those allies the Egyptians the Jordanians the Saudis privately would be relieved that America moved our embassy why is that because an American president and administration's strong enough to move the embassy and stand up to the nattering nabobs in the press might well also be a president and administration strong enough to stand up to Iran to end the catastrophic Obama Iranian nuclear deal and to do whatever is necessary to prevent the Ayatollah Khomeini from getting nuclear weapons and indeed we saw that assessment was true I think it is quite fitting that the opening of the new embassy occurred just days apart from the president making the historic decision to pull out of the disastrous Obama Iran nuclear deal we are seeing the difference between strength and weakness if history teaches anything it is that weakness and appeasement do not work and instead I think America is far better when we pursue policies of peace through strength we all recognize there are those who rage against the existence of the State of Israel there are the ayatollahs of Iran who swear death to Israel and death to America indeed who refer to Israel as the little Satan in America as the Great Satan and who finance terrorism at Israel's doorstep and across the world there are the terrorists of Hamas who seized control of the Gaza Strip over a decade ago after Israel had already fully withdrawn from the territory for the last several months Hamas has been organizing civilian mobs with terrorist cells embedded throughout to attack Israel's border and the soldiers stationed there they call the riots the march of return in reference to what they call their right of return which is a euphemism for having millions of descendants of Palestinians flood into Israel and destroy the modern State of Israel and its existence as a Jewish state Hamas times they're weeks of riots to culminate this week during what they call knock ba day not knock about means the catastrophe it is the word they use to reference the creation of Israel Madam President we should understand that they denounce every year when Israel celebrates the creation of the modern State of Israel Hamas mourns the catastrophe to use their word that Israel even exists but inevitably in these battles for survival that Israel faces daily we can count on global media elites acting as little more than propaganda arms for Hamas and other terrorists and no week has that been more evident than this week Madam President I direct you to the front page of the New York Times from this week the New York Times is headline Israel kills dozens at Gaza border as US Embassy opens in Jerusalem anyone reading this headline goodness gracious why are the Israelis murdering people that's what the New York Times says one takes from the coverage apparently poor innocent unarmed people are being shot for no reason by Israel that's certainly what the global media elite are portraying what are the actual facts you remember facts the things that used to be reported when journalists were actually being journalists and not propagandists well let's talk about the facts for several weeks we've seen riots and violent attacks at Israel's border terrorist attacks that culminated in the attacks that led to these shootings in self-defense the rioters they use massive tire fires to create smoke to cover their attacks they use guns they use pipe bombs they use Molotov cocktails they use grenades they use mechanical catapults to attack the border and to attack Israeli troops they tie petrol bombs to kites and they launch them to set fire to Israeli fields and livestock's the kites well let's take a look at the kites the kites that they use are painted with swastikas just so you're not confused about their motivations their pictures taken a couple of weeks ago of kites of images of swastikas by the Hamas terrorists with gasoline bombs designed to commit murder and mayhem the Palestinians and the riots they don't hide their motives or intentions it's not that the New York Times can't figure it out it's that they don't care one 23 year old rioter said quote we are excited to storm and get inside and that if he got across the border he would do whatever is possible to kill throw stones Madam President I would note a violent terrorist attacking the border seeking to murder people he's not a peaceful protester as the useful idiots in the media falsely portray them another Hamas terrorist who is flying swastika kite told NPR and this is a quote this is a kite that's going to go to the Jews the Jews go crazy for Hitler when they see it this is actually what we want them to know that we want to burn them now let me remind you again of the New York Times headline the New York Times headline says Israel kills dozens at Gaza border kills dozens of of what of whom do they say terrorists do they say Hamas terrorists flying swastika kites filled with gasoline seeking to murder Israelis who say quote this is actually what we want them to know that we want to burn them a rational person when hearing about brave soldiers protecting innocent civilians from terrorists seeking to murder them that is a good thing when terrorists are stopped before they can carry out their acts of terror but the New York Times can't be bothered to include those facts there is a message to be conveyed and for anyone lacking nuance or subtlety their message is simple Israel bad is real bad that that that's their whole subtlety and mind you the bodies of those poor helpless little terrorists well you know when a terrorist seeks to commit murder we do everything possible to prevent them from doing so so when you read the headline understand this is who the New York Times is celebrating although I ask you Madam President why wasn't the swastika on the cover of the New York Times might people understand it differently if they actually showed photographs of what was happening one of Hamas as Facebook pages posted maps with directions to nearby Israeli communities where thousands of Israelis live within two miles of the border if you look at this map this map is posted so you didn't understand these protesters are not just there saying you know make love man not war New York Times want to paint wants to paint them as some happy little hippies with daisies in their ears just give peace a chance you know John and Yoko are among them well why is Hamas posting this map saying if you cross the border here's where the Israeli communities are to go and murder Israelis here's the map if you make it across the border here's where you can find victims to kill as many of them as possible they're not hiding their intentions this is not subtle if you get across the border your target is wherever you can find Jews to kill these are the terrorists that the New York Times celebrates kills dozens why is it that the New York Times doesn't mention the maps that they have to Israeli homes to murder innocent women and children to kill as many Jews as possible here's a partial list of what happened on the border over just a few hours on Monday at 12:53 p.m. there were five pipe bomb detonations at 12:58 another explosive device was detonated at 1:15 a terror cell opened fire at his Raley soldiers who caught them trying to plant bombs at 1:30 there was another shooting attack at Israeli soldiers at 1:45 there was yet another shooting attack this time by a terror cell of eight using the rioters as cover as human shields at 2:09 there were three more bomb detonations at 2:13 there was a Molotov cocktail attack at 249 there was another Molotov cocktail attack at 310 there was yet another bomb attack and so on and so on and so on that's just two hours we're in the New York Times headline and sadly this is emblematic of much of the global media elite who are unified in their antagonism to the State of Israel where is any acknowledgment pipe bombs Molotov cocktails shooting how would this headline read differently if violet Hamas terrorists opened fire on Israelis who defend innocent civilians taking the lives of the terrorists that actually would be news that actually would be factual that actually would be describing what happened instead of becoming a propagandist for the terrorists the strategy for these riots for these terror attacks it's a win-win for Hamas if they breach Israel's fence then their terrorists can rush into Israeli towns try to kidnap and kill Israel's civilians if they fail to breach the fence they attacked the fence and Israeli soldiers defend Israel and if they're shot then they know that the media the useful idiots will provide endless photographs and stories denouncing Israel how dare you kill terrorists before they're able to murder innocent civilians the media has been more than happy to oblige Hamas is propaganda needs reporters celebrity Talking Heads and members of our political establishment have faithfully and enthusiastically parroted the Hamas line they say that the riots are the fault of the United States for moving our embassy and that the rioters are peaceful and unarmed protesters there's a word for that it's called a lie and when so-called journalists repeatedly and deliberately lie in the name of propaganda well they shouldn't be surprised to have earned the moniker fake news the Hamas talking points which are printed by our media are aimed at whitewashing the terrorists genocide 'el hatred of Israel in fact these attacks are waged because Hamas refuses to accept the existence of Israel mind you Gaza they control Israel doesn't govern Gaza Hamas governs Gaza this is an attack on the border of Israel seeking to murder innocent civilians the New York Times has been unremitting in its dishonesty they told their tens of thousands of Facebook followers that Israel quote use tear gas and gunfire to keep Palestinian protesters from crossing the border fence with Gaza killing at least 52 according to Palestinian officials 40 miles away officials celebrated the US Embassy's relocation to Jerusalem once again let's pull up the kites this is the New York Times pretending to report Israel used tear gas and gunfire to keep Palestinian protesters from crossing the border fence with Gaza killing at least 52 these are not protestors these are terrorists seeking to murder people when you call a terrorist a peaceful and unarmed protestor directly contrary to the facts you're not engaged in journalism you're pursuing a political agenda on the pages of the old grey link their websites headline on Monday blared Israel kills 58 and injures over 1300 by gunfire at Gaza border a mass attempt by Palestinians to cross the border fence quickly turned violent as Israeli soldiers responded with rifle fire gosh we're in their headlines we're in their coverage is any mention that these are terrorists with bombs and guns and Molotov cocktails and kites carrying gasoline no no no these were just protesters who for no reason whatsoever those bad bad Israelis decided to shoot they just got up and said let's just shoot a bunch of people that's what the New York Times tells us for no reason whatsoever they just began firing into the crowd by the way if you go in to the fever swamps of social media and you see the left the New York Times knows what it's propaganda does it's not hard to find people on Twitter suggesting that for no reason Israeli just began shooting people cuz you know shooting people is fun because remember their message is not complicated Israel bad and so if Israel bad then you just start shooting people because that's how you approach them on day morning that's the message and it's heard by social media it's heard by anti-semites across the globe it plays into vicious blood libels that go back millennia just happens to be alive not an accidental misstatement a deliberate calculated repeated lie undoubtedly tragically some of those killed have been Palestinians civilian human shields this is by design Madam President part of what Hamas does as it uses terrorists to commit acts of terror and then it uses innocent Palestinians as human shields trying to get them killed because that serves their propaganda purposes although I will say consistently during these riots it's turned out that a great many of the deaths are of the actual Hamas terrorists picked off while planting bombs and attacking Israeli soldiers the American military had been able to shoot the terrorists on 9/11 who flew airplanes into the World Trade Center who flew an airplane into the Pentagon the military had been able to stop those terrorists and shoot those terrorism in the New York Times reading the headline would read American military shoots peaceful flying passengers when you stop a terrorist seeking to commit murder it is not shooting a peaceful protester during past riots Hamas has acknowledged that up to 80% of those killed were terrorists this time around already between 1/3 and 1/2 of those killed have been identified as terrorists look this is Hamas telling you this the people being shot our avowed terrorist there's no dispute that Hamas is a terrorist organization there's no dispute this is their wall of martyrs these are the terrorists that we have sent who were killed where was the word terrorist in the coverage now you saw on TV images of violence on the border juxtaposed with the image of the embassy unveiling no doubt intended to put the blame for the attempted terrorism to put the plane blame on the United States how dare the United States of America actually stand with Israel how dare America open an embassy in the capital of Israel the blame for the violence lies with the terrorists not America for standing with our friend you know what these terrorists they hated Israel they hated Jews and they hated America before we moved our embassy and their compatriots hate America hate Israel and hate Jews after we moved our embassy their hatred their murderous religious zealotry is the cause of the murder of the violence a Hamas spokesman went further on TV and said that in the last round of confrontations if 62 people were martyred 50 of them were Hamas but gosh Madam President the New York Times just said a bunch of unarmed protestors were standing there when for no reason Israeli soldiers began shooting them what complete mendacity Hamas admits these are Hamas terrorists and yet the media does all they can to hide that imagine the outrage if when the American Embassy in Benghazi was attacked by Ansar al-sharia in 2012 a newspaper had printed quote Americans killed dozens of Libyans by the way that's the exact same headline the New York Times did yes protesters coming to commit murder soldiers fight back to stop them from committing murder fortunately even the New York Times didn't quite have the gall to say that but the facts are comparable the blame for all of the deaths whether terrorist or human shields is on Hamas and Hamas alone any implication otherwise is nothing less than shameful support for genocide 'el terrorism in 2014 I introduced in this body bipartisan legislation along with New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand a Democrat supporting Israel's right to self-defense and condemning Hamas is barbaric tactics specifically condemning the use of human shields as a war crime that resolution passed the United States Senate unanimously that passed the House of Representatives unanimously and yet we see the tactic yet again these terrorists using human shields using innocent Palestinians as human shields precisely because they want them to die because they can trust the global media to carry their message a few years back when Israel faced rocket attacks from Hamas one after the other after the other Hamas had its headquarters in the basement of a hospital indeed some years ago I wrote an op-ed entitled a tale of to hospitals it says you could tell a lot about a society about how they treat their most vulnerable and it compared to hospitals one the ZIF hospital in northern israel which i visited at the time the Zipp hospital had provided over eight million dollars in free medical care to syrians badly wounded in the horrific civil war playing out in syria freely caring for their neighbors being murdered by their own head of government the op-ed contrasted that hospital to the hospital in gaza in whose basement hamas had their headquarters now for hamas it was a win-win scenario option a is that israel refrains from hitting the headquarters because it is in the basement of a hospital that's obviously a win because then the terrorists headquarters doesn't get targeted in a military conflict that ultimately is what happened and the israeli forces did not hit hamas as headquarters but option two from a mosses perspective is also when if israel did strike at their headquarters a military target that was launching military attacks trying to murder israelis then the result would be pictures of dead bodies on CNN in the new york times pictures of patients at that hospital being used as human shields it is Hamas desiring the death of little Palestinian babies newborn in the maternity ward because they knew if Israel actually took out Hamas as headquarters they could take those babies who ammas had used as human shields and they could count on the New York Times can you imagine mr. president the headline in the New York Times Israel bombs babies it's not markedly different from their headline Israel kills dozens at Gaza border it's propaganda as long as Hamas has leaders who manipulate them who lie to the Palestinian people who lie to the world and who used human shields in their bloody terrorist campaign against Israel there can never be hope for peace of prosperity Israel has the right to defend itself and Israel is defending itself I only wish our global media had some tiny passing qualms of guilt to at least pretend to report the news to at least pretend to tell the truth to not function as Hamas as propaganda agents let me see the kites again but instead to tell the truth that when Hamas terrorists say with their Nazi swastika kite bombs that we want the Israelis to know we want them to burn these are the facts they need a report even if it happens to disagree with their political agenda of undermining the State of Israel but fortunately mr. president regardless of the partisan bias regardless of the propaganda that the New York Times and other global media outlets put out America the American people stand and will continue to stand unshakably unshakably alongside our friends and allies the people of Israel and we have reason to celebrate when I was in Jerusalem just a couple of days ago I visited with person after person Israeli and America who were reduced to tears some Holocaust survivors and the phrase I heard more often than anything else was I thought I would never live to see the day well we did live to see the day America's Embassy should have been in Jerusalem 70 years ago it should have been there 60 years ago it should have been there fifty years ago twenty years ago ten years ago one year ago but fortunately America's Embassy is where it belongs today in Jerusalem the once an eternal undivided capital of Israel Jerusalem was the capital of Israel 3,000 years ago and Jerusalem is the capital of Israel today and the United States government recognizes that and just as Harry Truman did 70 years ago is leading the rest of the world to follow suit I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum Thank You mr. president it is shameful for the United Nations that I must stand before you today it is shameful that this meeting is even taking place Jerusalem is the holiest place on earth for the Jewish people it is the capital of the State of Israel period it is a fact that simply cannot be disputed King David declared Jerusalem the city of the Jewish people 3,000 years ago the Jewish Bible mentions Jerusalem 660 times our prayers recall Jerusalem holy name over and over again as our prime minister the first Prime Minister David ben-gurion said and I quote Jerusalem is an inseparable part of the history of Israel of the face of Israel I am holding an original coin it's from 67 ad it says in Hebrew and I quote freedom of Zion look in the envelope in front of you you will see you have a replica of the coin it is clear evidence from the time of our Second Temple it proves the ancient connection of Jews to Jerusalem I were born to Jerusalem is unbreakable no UNESCO declaration no empty speeches no General Assembly resolution will ever drive us from Jerusalem these are the facts this body does not want to heal these are the facts this body wishes to ignore so today I will tell you about another unbreakable bond the unbreakable bond of hypocrisy between the Palestinians and the United Nations some of cautioned that the United States decision is one-sided and harmful to peace the opposite is true it is a one-sided steps of the Palestinians and the UN that have pushed away peace for years with every anti-israel resolution with every attack on my people the UN has perfected its double standard we are now sitting in an open session an emergency session of the General Assembly this session has been open since 1997 we live in a world that is full of conflict and war but only when it to Israel the one through democracy in the Middle East that this assembly remain in a constant open session how many times as Israel reached its hand in peace since 1997 how many times have we offered the Palestinians to join us in dialogue how many times of these calls for peace been rejected all of us all of us have lost count when Prime Minister Barack offered the Palestinians a state in 2000 we were met with suicide bombers or our buses and shootings in our streets in 2005 by Minister Sharon disengaged from Gaza he removed every single Israeli home you will not find any settlements any occupation in Gaza anymore since then we have been attacked again and again with rockets and missiles aimed at our civilians yet this body was silent the United States simply stated a fact they officially declared what has always been true Jerusalem has been and always will be the capital of the state of Israel those who support today's resolution are like puppets you are puppets pulled by the strings of your Palestinian puppet masters you are like marionettes forced to dance while the Palestinian leadership looks on with glee you are blind to the lies unaware of the manipulation surrounding you just like a puppet this vote is nothing more performance of delusion the Palestinians know this resolution is a fraud they know this resolution that absolutely nothing for the light of the Palestinian people they know it won't create jobs for their people they know it won't provide better health care for the people of Ramallah or Gaza no this resolution is nothing more than a distraction all it will do is tell the Palestinians they can continue rejecting peace and if you vote for it you are sanctioning that view I thank those brave countries that do not support this resolution you have not fallen prey to the puppet show before us you are the defenders of real peace you are the leaders who prove that no UN resolution can rewrite history because when a UN resolution designates Israel's presence in Palace of Jerusalem as illegal in reality it designates the presence of the Jewish people at the western wall as a legal mr. president for thousands of years Jews had only partial access over even banned completely from the Western world other nations kingdoms and empires that occupied Jerusalem over the centuries had no respect for freedom of religion but when Israel was founded we established a strong democracy our democracy is based on individual freedoms one of those freedoms is the freedom of religion in all these years later our democracy and our commitment to those freedoms continue to thrive we know Jerusalem is sacred to billions around the world is well respects all religions and encourages everyone to visit and pray in the holy city mr. president there is a particular irony with today's resolution countries that sponsor today's resolution accuse the United States and Israel of violating international law countries like Yemen well terror groups like al-qaeda and Isis find fertile ground the ione continues in every other scenario this body preaches human rights and peace but not when it comes to Israel in fact you completely ignore the effect acts of terror that threaten is very citizens these past two weeks alone obscene 23 rocket attacks by Hamas into Israel we heard nothing from the UN no Security Council meeting no emergency session of the General Assembly nothing the PA threatened violence and days of Rage but the UN had no condemnation mr. president let me be clear violence and terror must never be tolerated if this body were really well tell Kahneman and I now give the floor to his Excellency Israel cats Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel Music excellencies ladies and gentlemen I Israel cuts son of Holocaust survivors mayor and Malka cuts made a Western peace and proud to stand here today at the podium of the United Nations of the Foreign Minister of the State of Israel for me this is a very moving moment in 1947 the UN recognized the right of the Jewish people to its own state in the Land of Israel and 71 years ago we established the State of Israel since then we have dependent and developed our homeland and today the State of Israel is strong and advanced a startup nation that leads in many fields Israel is a real democracy for all of its citizens Jewish and non-jewish alike but first of all Israel if the nation-state of the Jewish people based on thousands of years of Jewish history and the right of the Jewish people to its own homeland just as the UN decided 72 years ago I want to thank the President of the United States Donald Trump for his historic and brave decision to recognize Jerusalem the eternal capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years as the capital of Israel and to relocate the American Embassy to Jerusalem I call on all countries to follow the United States and to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel no one can separate the Jewish people from our historical homeland and no one can separate us from Jerusalem our eternal capital Israel wants peace with all its neighbors we sign peace agreement with Egypt and Jordan and are walking today to advance our relations with many Arab state in the region we call on the palestinian authority to stop incitement to stop encouraging and financing terrorism and to recognize the right of the Jewish people to its own state we call on the Palestinians to come back to direct negotiations without any preconditions in Gaza the terrorist organization Hamas is holding two Israeli citizens of our melody stone and sham and side and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers Hadar Goldin in a horn I call on the UN to implement the decisions that you took on this issue and not allow any country to provide a together until Hamas returns them to their families the other day I heard president Allen attacks Israel and I want to say to him you that brutally oppress the Turkish people slaughter the Kurdish minority and support the terror organization Hamas you are the last one that can lecture Israel you are not the Sultan and tokey is not the Ottoman Empire shame on you the main problem threatening stability and security in the Middle East is a one which threatens to destroy Israel and works against the regimes of many countries in the region Iran uses its proxy to organizations his balloon Lebanon Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza the hood is in Yemen and shi'ite militias in Syria in Iraq against Israel and also against other state in the Middle East we recently saw a serious escalation in which a won and missiles were launched from Iran against Saudi oil facilities in order to destabilize world also flies this terror attack against Saudi Arabia was done on the direct orders of Iranian leader Ali Tamina e Iran is the biggest devil state and the biggest sponsor of terror in the world I call on the international community to unite in order to stop Iran the world cannot allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons the world cannot allow Iran to develop ballistic missiles and the world must stop Iran from supporting terror organizations in the region the UN must declare Hizballah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards of terror organizations they promote arrow in the Middle East Europe Latin America and all over the world and the world must stop them I call on the international community to support president wants maximum pressure policy against Iran this is the way to stop them we must stop one today in order to prevent war tomorrow and to the Iranian leadership I say in their own language juju or hooray for his Mishima one you don't count the birds till the end of the phone it isn't over till it's over excellencies ladies and gentlemen the reality in the Middle East also present opportunities for cooperation and advancing the economy of all countries in recent years Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have developed the trucks for regional peace initiative which will connect the Arab Gulf states by well through Jordan to the Israeli port in Haifa it will provide them a faster shorter and safer outlet to the Mediterranean we are also going to connect the Palestinian Authority to this project and this will boost their economy I presented this initiative to the UN Secretary General when we recently met in Abu Dhabi and invited him to take part in this important project Israel has a clear policy to advance ties a normalization with Arab Gulf states we have no conflict with the Gulf states and we have common interest in the field of security against the Iranian faiths as well as in developing many joint civilian initiatives Israel have a lot of capabilities in many areas including high-tech innovation agriculture and water technology which can help the Gulf states and the Gulf states have a lot of capabilities that can help Israel as well I hope the dis cooperation will lead to the signing of peace agreements between our countries as we did with Egypt and Jordan allow me to conclude with the words of the prophet Isaiah two thousand of years ago invited all the nations of the world to come to pray in Jerusalem Bhavya team L how could she the FEMA team the vet ability although the embassy frame Leggett Salam is betray ki beti bet the fee like a rain the whole army I will bring them to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all people as we are about to celebrate the Jewish New Year I would like to close with the traditional Jewish blessing for

this podium is it okay what the heck I'm the Prime Minister thank you great good to see you thank you I'll get there - don't worry great to see you thank you so so today I want to ask you you remember that great Clint Eastwood movie the good the bad and the ugly well I want to talk about the good the bad and the beautiful the good are all the good things that we are doing in Israel that are helping to make the world a better place the bad are all the bad things that malevolent forces are trying to do to Israel and to the world and specifically I'm talking about Iran and the beautiful well that our leave to the last so first the good news Israel has never been stronger militarily tremendously strong that's an f-35 fighter plane the most advanced in the world that's an Iron Dome interceptor and many other systems that we developed with the help of America Thank You America thank you successive American presidents Thank You Congress Republicans and Democrats alike thank you way back for helping bring this about you're terrific and this this incredible this incredible military is buttressed by superb intelligence unmatched in the world can you see me I can hardly see you I have to get closer yeah I see that's good superb intelligence you know in the last few years Israel's incredible intelligence services have foiled dozens dozens of major terrorist attacks across the world in dozens of countries that plane a plane like that could have been blown out of the sky if it weren't for Israeli intelligence a plane heading from Australia to the Persian Gulf you're boarding planes when you leave this place you are safer because of Israeli intelligence it not only protects Israeli lives it protects innocent lives around the world and we're able to do all this because of the extraordinary soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces men and women look at men and women black and white religious and secular gay and straight Jews Muslims Christians Druze citizens they come from different backgrounds but they're united with a common mission to protect the State of Israel they keep us safe they make us proud thank you now I know now I know there are quite a few veterans of the Israeli army here so I want you to stand up I want you to be recognized stand up stand up but the good news the good news doesn't stop merely with Israel's strong military it continues with Israel's strong economy it's a tremendously strong economy and I'll tell you we made it stronger by moving Israel to free-market principles which unleashed the spark of genius embedded in our people into innovation entrepreneurship and there's a revolution taking place this couldn't happen at the the better time look at the ten leading companies in 2006 five energy companies one one IT company Microsoft in a mere ten years later 2016 a blink of an eye in historical terms it's completely reversed five IT companies one energy company left the true wealth is an innovation you know these companies Apple Google Microsoft Amazon Facebook guess what they all have research centers in Israel all of them major research centers and they're not alone there are hundreds more and there's a reason something is going on it's a great change it's you want to hear jargon one sentence this is a terrible sentence but I have no other way to say it's the confluence of big data connectivity and artificial intelligence okay you get that you know what that does it revolutionizes old industries and it creates entirely new industries so here's an old industry that Israel was always grading agriculture we always good in agriculture but now we have precision agriculture you know what that is see that drone in the sky he's connected to a big database and there are sensors in the field and in the field there's irrigation and drip fertilization and now we can target with this technology the water that we give the fertilizer that we give down to the individual plant that needs it that's precision agriculture that's Israel unbelievable you know we were always good in water I want you to see how good we are so we recycle almost 90 percent of our waste water the next country with less than 20% is Spain you can see how Israel what it does for water what it does for the environment so when you take these two things agriculture and water and the other technologies that we apply in both we can change the world we are we are I just heard about an African woman in Africa has to walk eight hours a day to give water to her children four hours one way to a well four hours back and the youngest rarely company brought in this technology that improves on Moses remember Moses he brought water from Iraq they bring water from thin air they bring water to Africa to millions of people in Africa Israeli technology and I was just recently in India that's my friend Prime Minister Narendra Modi great friend I'm showing him cherry tomatoes this is in Gujarat India this is Israeli technology and what I heard there was fantastic farmers came from the region there's an experimental farm there in a place where Israel gives technology know-how to Indian farmers 65 of India 65 percent of India's population our farmers and one farmer after the other gets up and says because of Israeli technology I've increased my crop yields and my income three times four times five times Israel is changing the world in India in Asia in Africa and Latin America everywhere these are the old industries now there are new industries Israel is literally how can I say this Israel is literally driving the world I'm talking about autonomous vehicles Israel is a world leader in autonomous vehicles 500 tech companies that sprang out almost instantaneously and one of them mobile I up there on the left was just sold to Intel for the paltry sum of fifteen billion dollars but the interesting thing is that Intel said to them here are the keys to our 30 worldwide autonomous vehicle businesses you run it Israeli technology is driving the world and one last industry there are many more but one more that you're all familiar with you have bank accounts you should okay well you don't want anyone hacking into them right or into your cars or into the planes you ride you need cyber security everybody needs cyber Israel has become a world leader in cyber security look at how much they invest in the hundreds of Israeli startup companies tremendous companies but here's another factor that you should know Israel's population is how much who knows class eight but it's closer to nine but it's about between eight and nine million that's correct and what percentage of that is of the world's population all come Hong it's one tenth of one percent so what percentage do we get of the world global investment in cyber security and private investment in cyber security were one tenth of one percent of the world's population and we get a whopping 20% of global private investment in cyber we're punching we're punching 200 times above our weight not two times not ten times not a hundred times 200 times above our weight that's one heck of a punch very strong now here's how the dots connect because we have this tremendous capacity for security and intelligence and because we have this tremendous capacity for civilian technology for making the lives of people richer safer more productive many countries are coming to Israel because they want to share with us these benefits and that creates the third great change which is a flourishing of Israel's diplomatic relations around the world you know when I joined when I joined the Foreign Service 105 years ago as the DCM to this city Washington the number two in our embassy I think we had about 80 or 90 countries with whom we had diplomatic relations now the number is 160 and there are very few countries left by the way what are we doing with Greenland we got to do something with Greenland where's my advance team go to Greenland they must have some satellite needs or something that we could do there but we are coloring the world blue I've been to Africa three times in 18 months I've been to South America Latin America can you imagine in the 70 years of history of Israel a Prime Minister of Israel never went south of Texas I mean I love Texas but yeah I do but we went to Argentina we went to Argentina to Colombia to Mexico and they say come back come back we want more that is changing all these countries are coming to us India China Mongolia Kazakhstan all of them Azerbaijan Muslim countries first time I visited Australia tremendous far away though so we're coloring the world blue and you know what the numbers you remember people talked about Israel's isolation remember that Israel's isolation pretty soon the countries that don't have relations with us they're going to be isolated there are those who talk about boycotting Israel will boycott them so the good news is very good and it's getting better the bad news and that's the bad news is that bad things are getting worse and they're very bad and when I talk about that we have to deal with this challenge and I'm thinking specifically what do we do about Iran the force behind so much of what is bad is this radical tyranny in Tehran if I have a message for you today it's a very simple one we must stop Iran we will stop Iran when I last spoke here I warned try to warn the world about a nuclear deal that was a threat to the survival of Israel the security of the region the peace of the world I warned that Iran's regime had repeatedly lied to the international community that it could not be trusted I warned that the deal gives Iran a clear path towards developing a nuclear arsenal in little more than a decade and I warned that by removing Iran sanctions Iran's regime would not become more moderate and peaceful but more extreme and belligerent much more dangerous and ladies and gentlemen that's exactly what has happened here is what Iran is doing today can you enlarge that no can you see that yeah okay well darkness is descending on our region Iran is building an aggressive Empire Iran Iraq Syria Lebanon Gaza Yemen more to come now Iran is seeking to build permanent military bases in Syria seeking to create a land bridge from Tartus from Tehran to tattoos on the Mediterranean and in addition to moving its army its Air Force its Navy to Syria to be able to attack Israel from closer hand it's also seeking to develop to build precision guided missile factories in Syria in Lebanon against Israel I will not let that happen we will not let that happen we must stop Iran we will stop Iran last week we read in the book of Esther about an earlier Persian attempt to exterminate our people they failed then then fail now we will never let Iran develop nuclear weapons not now not in 10 years not ever President Trump has made it clear that his administration will not accept Iran's aggression in the region he has made clear that he too will never accept a nuclear-armed Iran that is the right policy I salute President Trump on this and the president has also made it clear that if the fatal flaws of the nuclear deal are not fixed he will walk away from the deal and restore sanctions Israel will be right there by American side and let me tell you Seoul will other countries in the region as we counter Iran's aggression we should always remember we should always remember the brave people of Iran their suffering their hopes their courage women are jailed for removing their hijabs students are tortured tortured and shocked for advocating freedom we stand with those in Iran who stand for freedom now I believe I believe that a day will come when this horrible tyranny will disappear will perish from the earth and at that point the historic friendship between the people of Israel and the people of Persia will be reestablished today we have Haman Amman tomorrow we'll have Cyrus and friendship and peace my friends as we work together to confront the bad there is also potential to advance the good that paradoxically comes from the bad because most of the state in our region know they know very well believe me that Israel is not their enemy but their indispensable ally in confronting our common challenges and seizing our common opportunities this is true for Egypt and Jordan Israel's longtime peace partners but it's also true for many other Arab countries in the Middle East Israel remains committed to achieving peace with all our neighbors including the Palestinians President Trump has made it clear that he is committed to peace I have made it clear that I'm committed to peace we appreciate the efforts of President Trump superb team Jared Kushner Jason Greenblatt and ambassador David Freedman thank you all thank you all for your hard work for peace but to get peace to get peace President Abbas has to embrace peace and to stop supporting terror raise your hands high if you agree with me that President Abbas should stop paying terrorists to murder Jews you know how much he pays he pays about three hundred and fifty million dollars a year to terrorists and their families each year that's about a little less than 10% of the total Palestinian budget that's an incredible number he pays Hakim Awad Hakim Awad is the terrorist who murdered this beautiful family of Eldon Ruth Fogle and their three children including a three-month-old baby girl hadass so he pays Hakeem Adonis murder and over the lifetime of this killer he will be receiving 2 million dollars I have a message for President Abbas stop paying terrorists because what message what message does ascent to Palestinian children it says murder Jews and get rich and I believe President Abbas should find better use for this money to build roads schools hospitals factories build life don't pay death invest in life invest in peace Israel hopes that the passage of the taylor force act will make clear to President Abbas that America has zero tolerance for terror ladies and gentlemen I spoken about the good and the bad there's plenty of both but I want to end with a few words about the beautiful oh that's very kind of you that's very kind of you I love you too thank you who planted her I'm talking about the beautiful alliance between Israel and the United States of America I'm talking about the beautiful alliance that have brought all of you here to Washington the beautiful alliance that you work day in and day out to make stronger and to make better what is this beautiful alliance made up it's made of our shared values that's the wellspring of the great alliance between our two countries and all you have to do is leave this room leave the song and you walk around a few blocks from here and you see these majestic monuments you can learn from them all about our common values you know they come from a certain book a great book a good book it's called the Bible it said that all of us are created in the image of God and those words inspired jefferson when he declared in the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal all women too by the way and that book inspired Abraham Lincoln in the darkest days of America Civil War he found inspiration in the words of our greatest king King David when he said that the wounds of a divided America would heal and the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous just as the stirring words of the prophet amos inspired the great Martin Luther King when he stood before the Lincoln Memorial and promised to carry on his struggle until justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream these values are an inseparable part of America's story they're an inseparable part of Israel's story and today together we are writing a new chapter in our common story a story of freedom of Justice of Peace of Hope and it is because we're inspired by the same ideas because we're animated by the same values that America and Israel have forged an internal bond that can never ever be broken thank you AIPAC god bless Israel god Bless America and God bless the Israel America alliance thank you all thank you Music Applause Music Applause
