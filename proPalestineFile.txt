La Boheme in the name of God the compassionate the merciful your excellency secretary-general of the United Nations president of the United Nations General Assembly ladies and gentlemen peace be upon you 24 years have passed since the signing of the Oslo Accords an interim agreement that set a five-year period for bringing an end to the Israeli occupation granting hope to the Palestinian people that they would soon achieve independence within their state and achieve peace between Palestinians and Israelis what is left of this hope today president ladies and gentlemen we recognize the State of Israel on the 1967 borders but Israel is continuous refusal to recognize these borders has put into question the mutual recognition we signed in Oslo in 1993 since my speech before your August assembly last year when I appealed for 2017 to be the year for ending the Israeli occupation of the territory of the state of Palestine the Israeli government has relentlessly pursued its settlement campaign on our land in contravention of all international conventions and the relevant resolutions on the question of Palestine it has also persisted with its flagrant disregard for the two-state solution resorting to procrastination policies and tactics and revising pretexts to evade its responsibility to end its occupation of the territory of the state of Palestine instead of addressing the underlying issues and resolving the root causes of the conflict it has tried to divert international attention towards secondary issues actually caused by its colonial policies while we call just as the international community continues to do for an end to the Israeli occupation of the territory of our state it incites and makes false accusations pretense there is no Palestinian partner and imposes unreasonable obstructive conditions Israel as well aware as you are all that is that it's occupation breeds incitement and violence and this military occupation by Israel of our land has now lasted for over half a century ten years ago we agreed together to establish a tripartite committee comprising the United States Palestine and Israel in order to address the issue of incitement and that the decision lies with the United States and this committee has worked for some time but then it was cancelled and since then we have been calling for the revival of this committee to no avail so who is during the incitement now who is now trying to maintain incitement what is strange it is thus very strange to hear some of those who hold the responsibility to end this occupation referring to it as an a half occupation or an alleged occupation so what what do you mean by alleged occupation for 50 years we have been languishing under the yoke of occupation and now somebody who is responsible is saying that this is an alleged occupation I believe this is not fair and incorrect and unacceptable the continuation of this occupation is an affront to Israel and the international community the United Nations bares illegal political moral and humanitarian obligation to end this occupation and enable the Palestinian people to live in freedom and prosperity and their independent state of Palestine with East Jerusalem the occupied East Jerusalem as its capital on the 4th of June 1967 borders this is your responsibility this is the responsibility of the international unity beyond any doubt draining the quagmire of colonial occupation of our land and ending its unjust oppressive and illegal practices against our people would have a great bearing to fight terrorism and deprive terrorist groups of one of the key rallying cries they exploit to promote their of securin test ideas therefore we reiterate that ending the Israeli occupation of our land is of urgency and it is needed to supplement the efforts that we are all undertaking to confront such groups we Palestinians are against internal and international organizations regardless of its nature its source or its character we are standing against international terrorism and we are fighting it president ladies and gentlemen we have explored every avenue and exerted far-reaching efforts to achieve peace with our Israeli neighbors and together with the Arab and Islamic states have adopted an invaluable initiative the Arab Peace Initiative aimed at resolving the Palestinian and arab-israeli conflict according to this initiative upon Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967 namely Gulen and Lebanese forms occupied in 1967 the Arab and Islamic states would recognize Israel and normalize relations with its so what was the response of Israel to initiative 57 Arab and Islamic states said they are ready that if Israel withdraws from those territories occupied in 1967 all these states will immediately recognize Israel and normalize relation with it and Israel is not interested there was also the quartet roadmap in 2003 put forward by the quartet for peace endorsed by the Security Council and accepted by Palestine it was also rejected by the Israeli government so Israel is above the law and to break this stalemate and the peace process and to ensure successful peace efforts there came the French initiative aimed at salvaging the peace process and the two-state solution led to holding the Paris conference earlier this year which was attended by 70 States 70 States I repeat and for international organizations all these efforts were met with the rejection and boycotting by Israel furthermore President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China have launched the initiatives for peace and the latest of these peace efforts all of which we are thankful for is being led by the United States President Donald Trump where are these initiatives and why Israel is not accepting these initiatives so on our part we have also repeatedly tried to revive the peace process and called on the Israeli prime minister to affirm to only affirm his commitment to the two-state solution and sit with us at the negotiations table to delineate the borders between Israel and the of Palestine in order to open a path for meaningful negotiations to resolve all other final status issues sitting together resolving the issue of borders and then discuss other matters unfortunately it was rejected by the Prime Minister we continued our genuine efforts for success of the peace process and despite these efforts Israel continues to breach its commitments and to obstruct efforts by continuing to build settlements everywhere building settlements everywhere there is no place left for the state of Palestine and this is not acceptable for us and for you you have the responsibility Palestine Israel also rejects the two-state solution and this poses a real threat to both people's the Israelis and Palestinians alike and this compels us to undertake a comprehensive strategic review of the entire process ladies and gentlemen commitment to peace should be from one side a commitment by one side to peace is never enough to achieve peace we have warned in the past and continue to warn of Israeli policies either we are free or not free we have warned in the past and continue to warn of Israeli policies aimed at entrenching the occupation and colonial facts on the ground in East Jerusalem we said that these policies fueled religious animosity that could lead to a religious conflict we have called on the Israeli government to uphold the historic and legal status Co of the holy sites in the city however the Israeli government since its occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967 yes it is an occupying power Jerusalem is occupied Israel has repeatedly annexed Jerusalem by a uni rattler unilateral decision Israel just decided to annex Golan and it did so we rejected that at that time and we still rejected today alongside the whole international community including the Security Council that have been many resolutions adopted by the Security Council the highest authority in the world stating that this annexation process is illegal to whom should we go the resolution the Security Council and those of the General Assembly are not implemented so to whom should we go we're not going towards terrorism or violence Jerusalem is an occupied City and Israel's decisions and practices there are null and void null and void and illegal in their entirety the same applies to all Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory it is an occupied territory as Ravus attempts to change the historic status quo in our codes and in particular with a V the state an integrity of al-aqsa mosque can only be described as playing with fire and an infringement upon our responsibilities as well as those of Brotherly Jordan both of the both of us are responsible for the city we koushin the Israeli government of the implications of such an aggression and we hold it fully responsible for the consequences don't ever try to go towards a religious war it is really dangerous for you and for us we don't want it our conflict is political let it remain political stay away from religious issues president ladies and gentlemen despite this ongoing occupation and its oppressive policies and practices we have been able to build the institutions of our state competently which has been recognized by a majority of member states of this organization 130 138 states among you the majority of the membership I seize this opportunity once again to thank all these countries that have recognised the state of Palestine and that have voted for upgrading the status of the of the State of Palestine ad the United Nations by doing so you are addressing a part of the historical injustice afflicted our people and endured by our people this also supports the objective of peace between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East and across the world at large last year before this August assembly I stressed in my speech that the status quo in the occupied territory of the state of Palestine is not sustainable however as the situation has only deteriorated due to Israel its insistence on preserving its occupation aggressive policies and endless violations of international law we must once again if this is the case : we on Israel as the the occupying power to fully respect and uphold all its obligations stemming from this occupation and also bear the consequences we cannot continue so be an authority without any authority we cannot remain an authority without any authority or to allow this occupation to continue without costs we are fast approaching this point if they don't want the two-state solution and they don't want peace let them bear their responsibilities and the consequences of these responsibilities because we're not going to bear any responsibilities in this case the two-state solution today is in jeopardy we cannot as Palestinians stand still in the face of this threat targeting our national political and social existence on our land and endangers regional and international peace and security we will have to take steps or look for alternatives to preserve our national existence and at the same time to keep open the prospect for peace and security however all the options that we are seeking will be peaceful peaceful peaceful in such a situation it is our right to search for alternatives that preserve our rights and protect our land and our people from any and from an entrenching system of appetite that came to an end in South Africa long time ago but it still exists in Palestine is this acceptable can the world accept an apartheid regime in the first 21st century in Palestine why it is there on the other hand we have called on the International Criminal Court this is alright if nobody wants to listen to us then let us seek all avenues so we have called on the International Criminal Courts to open an investigation and to prosecute Israeli officials for their involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people and we will continue to pursue our accessions to international conventions protocols and organizations as Palestine has acquired observer status in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 67 / 19 of 2012 I will call for convening of the Palestinian National Council in the near future to operationalize this strat strategic review president ladies and gentlemen we as Palestinians in Arab and the whole world have the the choice of the international law and the two-state solution on the borders of 1967 and we will grant every chance for the efforts being undertaken by President Donald Trump and the quartet and the international community at large to I achieve a historic agreement or deal we have heard that they are seeking a historic deal and we would like to thank them we hope that this will take place so we stress the two-state solution enabling the state of Palestine to live side by side with the State of Israel in security and peace but if the two-state solution were to be destroyed due to the creation of a one-state reality with two systems apartheid from the unchecked imposition of this occupation that is rejected by our people and the international community this would be a failure and neither you nor we will have any other choice but to continue the struggle and demand full equal rights for all inhabitants of historic Palestine this is not a threat but we are warning of the realities and the consequences as a result of ongoing Israeli policies that are gravely undermining the two-state solution what do they want let them talk about other issues but our choice will remain the two-state solution our problem ladies and gentlemen is with the Israeli colonial occupation and not with Judaism as a religion judy's for us Palestinians Christians and Muslims will never be considered a threat it is an Abrahamic religion like Islam and Christianity God Almighty says in the Quran in the name of God the compassionate the merciful we do not distinguish between his messengers so all messengers are equal Muhammad Jesus and others all these religions are equal and we are not distinguished distinguishing between prophets or messengers and on this occasion we are congratulating the Jews for the occasion or on the occasion of the new year and we we will also congratulate and we would like to congratulate Muslims for the new head jury year starting tomorrow so this is a demonstration of approachment between religions president ladies and gentlemen we have dutifully upheld our responsibility towards our people in the Gaza Strip in spite of the division since in 2007 since then we have provided all forms of support on our own to our people in Gaza who are gravely suffering from the cruel Israeli blockade we have repeatedly affirmed that and no one is more conscious about the interests of our people in Gaza Strip we are keen on achieving the interests of people in Gaza we said that there will be no state in Gaza and there will be no Palestinian state without the Gaza Strip State in Gaza this is a false dream and our state will only complete with the Gaza Strip and today I must express my relief the agreement reached in in Cairo as a result of Egyptian efforts we are thankful for these efforts aimed at nullifying the measures taken by Hamas following the division including the formation of a government now the government has been consult and now there is commitment to the national unity or national consensus government to enable it exercise its authority in Gaza Strip and to allow for general elections to be held this agreement has been reached and we are satisfied with this agreement and next week our government is going to the Gaza Strip to assume its responsibilities we wish the governor and all success president ladies and gentlemen also in my speech before this assembly last year I appealed to the British government the government of Great Britain to rectify the grave injustice its inflicted upon the Palestinian people when it issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917 promising Jews a national homeland in Palestine despite the fact that Palestine was inhabited by the Palestinian people ninety-seven percent of the popular popular at that time were Palestinians we were disregarded again Palestine was inhabited by the Palestinian people and was among the most progressive and prosperous countries and should not have been colonized or placed under the mandate of a great power the British government has not taken any step until this moment to correct this historical injustice against our people it should apologise and provide us with compensations and recognize the state of Palestine we talked to them at length and so far they haven't responded what is even worse that in November they want to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of this crime against our people the Silence of the international community as to the Israeli aggressive policies has emboldened Israel to continue such policies let me remind you that Israel has violated international resolutions since its establishment it has violated the United Nations Charter and continues to do so as well as resolutions 8 1 1 9 4 2 4 2 dividing Palestine and it said through art articles 42 it says that those who conduct aggression against the land of others will be defeated by by by force Israel has taken a large part of our territory and it was not deterred by the United Nations there is also resolution 194 providing for the return of refugees at that time however the United Nations has not adopted any resolution and there is also another resolution calling for withdraw world resolution 3 3 8 and resolution 23 34 of the Security Council last year so where is this resolution if the United Nations cannot implement its resolutions who would implement these resolutions Israel doesn't want to Israel is above the law is it above the law ladies and gentlemen there is double standard in dealing with countries this is your responsibility president to salvage the peace process and the two-state solution I urge this organization and your honorable States to do the following first actively pursue efforts to bring an end to the Israeli occupation of the state of Palestine within a set timeframe let's say within this time frame the occupation will come to an end it is no longer enough to issue generic statements calling for the of occupation and the achievement of peace without a deadline efforts must be made to implement the Arab Peace Initiative including the just solution for the Palestinian refugee question in accordance with the resolution 194 the Arab initiative was great in addressing the issue of refugees when mentioning adjust and agreed upon solution not imposed upon a certain party in accordance with resolution 194 where is the mistake so these resolutions were disregarded by Israel Israel has ridden roughshod over these resolutions to whom should we go to whom should we complain second acted to bring to a halt all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory as demanded in numerous United Nation Nations resolutions including the most recent resolution 23 34 in addition to the operative paragraphs of the Fourth Geneva Convention so an occupying power should not expel the people from their land this is the text of the Fourth Geneva Convention who is responsible for implementing these texts Israel says no and what are we saying as international community third ensure international protection to the land and people of the state of Palestine until the end of the occupation as we are unable to provide protection to our people given all the forces and the arms that we are facing every day who would protect us if you don't many a time we have tabled draft resolutions and these go in vain forth demanded that Israel endorses and commits to the borders of 1967 as the the basis for the two-state solution and set such borders in line with international resolutions once we delineate the borders each party can act in its territory as it pleases without affecting or damaging the rights of the other party now Israel builds wherever it wishes demolishing houses every day even schools are being demolished hospitals nobody raises an eyebrow now i v i must ask you all the member states of the united nations those who have recognized israel they should state that they recognized Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders thus aligning themselves with international resolutions and reaffirming their commitment to these resolutions even those recognized Israel on the basis of 181 resolution 181 was violated allow me to ask a question where is where are the borders of Israel that you are recognizing where are these borders how can you recognize a state that has no borders it has not even decided on its own borders and international law states that the the state is a land with borders and Israel has no borders so how can you recognize a state that has no clear borders sixth I call on all states to end all forms of direct and indirect involvement with and support to the illegal Israeli colonial settlement regime on the land of the occupied state of Palestine in accordance with UN resolutions and with the affirmative of states in this regard and similar to the international community's approach to words the apartheid regime in South Africa we should not deal with settlements we should not condone settlements there's the blacklist of countries who are dealing illegally with Israeli settlements should be exposed and revealed seven I urge those states that have not recognized the state of Palestine yet to do so I don't understand how recognizing the state of Palestine on the borders of 1967 there could be minor amendments between the two parties but the foundation or the basis is 1967 so our borders are well known where are the borders of Israel I don't understand how recognizing the state of Palestine harms the chances of peace especially since we Palestinians have recognized Israel on the 1967 borders eight we look to the Security Council to approve our application for full membership of the State of Palestine to the United Nations what do we lack what is there that is missing every day we prove that we are eligible for such status all those who support the two-state solution should recognize the two states not one state Palestine and Israel if you recognize Israel you should recognize Palestine ix we urge the international community to continue to provide economic and financial support to the Palestinian people to achieve self-reliance if the occupation comes to an end we will tell you thank you we will be self-reliant unfortunately because there is occupation we can only seek assistance and we are grateful to you because you are rendering such assistance help us to get rid of occupation and we will we would thank you for your help we also urge you to continue providing support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinian refugees in the nearest Unruh an order for it to continue rendering humanitarian assistance in this respect we are warning that there are attempts to eliminate item 7 on the agenda of the Human Rights Council or to change the Mandate of UNRWA and also there are efforts to obstruct the issuance of the list of companies operating in Israeli settlements this is a blacklist why should we hide this list it is similar to terrorism everybody should see this list to know who violates international law and who respects such law so again the black list of companies operating in Israeli settlements in the territory of the occupied state of Palestine tenth we once again affirm our commitment to respect human rights and international conventions and to implement the United Nations sustainable development agenda 2030 and the Paris agreement on climate change and all other treaties and vengeance that we have acceded to anything that we have acceded to or adopted we respect it and we go side by side with the international community were part of this interest community president the state of Palestine will reflect on these imperatives and draft resolutions as appropriate to be presented to the United Nations General Assembly we call upon you all of you to vote in favor of these resolutions with the clear aim of preserving the two-state solution and salvaging and promoting the chances for achieving peace and to achieve prosperity for the Israelis and Palestinians alike and the peoples of the region at large in closing allow me ladies and gentlemen to salute our great people who remain steadfast in their homeland despite the suffering those who are struggling against foreign occupation peacefully and the culture of peace is prevailing among Palestinians among all Palestinians who are those people who join - ISIL none of them is from Palestine what does this mean I salute the our people in Jerusalem who have given one of the most bright examples of peaceful popular resistance against the Israeli colonial occupation when they prevented them from praying they prayed outside and they were praying and they were victorious I salute our people in exile and in diaspora I salute our people who remain steadfast in the West Bank and also the besieged Gaza Strip I salute our glorious martyrs and our courageous prisoners who are there in the Israeli jails I tell them all that freedom is coming it is inevitable it will come and that occupation shall come to an end it will either be the Independence of the State of Palestine to live side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel on the 1967 borders or equal or if they want if they wish equal rights for all of the inhabitants of the land of historic Palestine from the river to the sea will they accept so when South Africa was liberated from the apartheid regime Nelson Mandela said I am grateful to the whole world and the United Nations that have contributed to and supported the end of apartheid in South Africa and it so happened but Nelson Mandela added our victory is not complete until and the victory is rendered to the Palestinian people so we are entrusted and you are entrusted to end apartheid in Palestine all of us even the superpower they should stand by us this is a trust you should fulfill the trust are you going to do so thank you I hope so [Applause] oh no the last homily on behalf of the General Assembly I have the honor to welcome to the United Nations His Excellency mr. Mahmoud Abbas president of the state of Palestine and to invite him now to address the assembly similar Nara in the name of God the merciful the compassionate your excellency mr. Peter Thompson president of the General Assembly your excellency mr. ban ki-moon secretary-general of the United Nations excellencies ladies and gentlemen heads of delegations peace and God's blessing be upon you all I had hoped that I would not be compelled to deliver this statement today had the cause of my people been justly resolved genuinely heard and that hearts and minds would have acted to lift my people from oppression as you all are well aware we have accepted the primacy of international law the resolutions of international legitimacy and made a historic and immense sacrifice when the PLO the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people accepted to establish the state of Palestine on the 4th of June 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital what more can be asked of us we remain committed to the agreements reached with Israel since 1993 however Israel must reciprocate this commitment and must act forthwith to resolve all of the final status issues it must cease all of its settlement colonization activities and its aggressions against our cities villages and refugee camps it must cease its policies of collective punishment it's demolition of Palestinian homes it's extrajudicial executions and the arrests of our people in addition to releasing the thousands of prisoners and detainees it must also cease its aggression and provocations against the Holy al-aqsa mosque for all of these policies and practices prevent an environment in which peace can prevail in our region how can anyone seeking peace commit such actions in this regard we reaffirm that we cannot accept the current situation we will never accept the humiliation of our people we will never accept temporary or interim solutions our people will never accept to forego their national institutions and achievements having attained them through great sacrifice suffering and pain we will preserve the independence of Palestinian decision-making and we will act to fulfill the aspirations of our people via political and diplomatic means while relying on international law the legitimacy of international resolutions via the United Nations and all international fora we will seek to mobilize Arab and international efforts towards achieving this end we will not accept the continuation of the current situation the 1993 Oslo accord was intended to end the occupation to achieve the independence of the state of Palestine within five years yet Israel renounced the agreements it signed and to this moment it persists with its occupation and continues to expand its illegal settlements which undermines the realization of the two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders does Israel want one state despite the adoption of 12 resolutions by the Security Council condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories since 1967 none of these resolutions were implemented thus encouraging Israel to continue its plans for the Caeser of more Palestinian land in the West Bank including East Jerusalem with impunity the violent actions of Israeli settlers have gone as far as the formation of terrorist groups that set entire families on fire kill them destroy properties and uproot the trees that are the livelihoods of Palestinian families Israel's disrespect and contemptuous policies have gone as far as attempts to legalize the settlements and the settlers colonizing our occupied land since 1967 it even led to the Israeli Prime Minister claiming that the call for the cessation of settlements and their despair internment constitutes ethnic cleansing ethnic cleansing all such attempts are null and void and it will constitute a clear grave violation of international law so who then is practicing ethnic cleansing in this regard I am compelled to warn you again that what the Israeli government is doing in pursuit of its expansionist settlement plans will destroy whatever possibility is left for the two-state solution along the 1967 borders the settlements are illegal in every aspect and any manifestation the settlements are illegal we will therefore continue to exert all efforts for the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the settlements and the terror of the settlers and we are undertaking at the moment extensive consultations with Arab countries and other friendly countries on this matter and we hope that no one will cast a veto against this draft resolution Israel's racial discrimination against the Palestinian people has become a daily reality as it continues to favor the Israeli settlers on our occupied land including by granting them permits for residential construction as well as for factories economic projects and instruct infrastructure such as roads electricity and water networks while at the same time preventing the Palestinian owners the owners of the land from use of their land and profiting them from developing their economy in the West Bank including Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley and the Palestinian chores on the Dead Sea it continues with its illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip and continues to alter the identity and status of the occupied East Jerusalem to commit aggressions and provocations against our Christian and Muslim holy sites especially al-aqsa mosque these continued Israeli aggressions against our Muslim and Christian holy sites amounts to playing with fire again it amounts to playing with fire no one knows what will happen if these aggressions continue all of these Israeli policies actions and measures are the reasons behind the failure of all international efforts and particularly those of the international quartet over the past 13 years just as Israel had sabotaged the efforts of successful successive American administrations over the decades here I must once again appeal to you to provide international protection for the Palestinian people suffering under occupation since 1967 in the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip I extend my deep appreciation in this regard to the secretary-general and the Security Council members who convened an area meeting of the council to explore the options for international protection for my people and I urge that these efforts continue if you do not ensure our protection then who will who can provide us with international protection if the United Nations is unable to do so mr. president ladies and gentlemen Israel today continues its attempt to evade an international conference for peace which is a proposal by France a proposal that received the support of the majority of the world's countries in June of this year a ministerial meeting was held in Paris to prepare for this conference it was attended by 28 countries along with three intergovernmental organizations it remains our hope that such a conference will lead to the establishment of a mechanism and a time frame for an end to occupation in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the international community the principle of land for peace the Arab Peace Initiative which calls inter alia for a just and a great solution for Palestinian refugees in accordance with resolution 194 we hope that all states of the world will support the convening of this International Peace Conference before the end of this year if there is no international peace conference held and no direct negotiations between us and the Israelis then how can peace be made no peace conference and no negotiations how can we speak about peace how can we make peace mr. president ladies and gentlemen instead of Israel acknowledging the atrocities it committed and continues to commit against our people the Israeli prime minister has the audacity to criticize Palestine statement at the Arab League summit in walk shot in Mauritania because we referred to the buffer the declaration I say to him today that our recognition of the existence of the State of Israel in 1993 Eric a recognition which remains valid to this moment is not a complementary recognition Israel must reciprocate with a similar recognition of the state of Palestine we recognize Israel and continue to recognize Israel however Israel must recognize the state of Palestine and put an end to its occupation of our land so that the state of Palestine can coexist alongside the State of Israel in peace and security as good neighbors while each within secure and recognized borders mr. president ladies and gentlemen there is no conflict between us and the Jewish religion and its people not at all our conflict is with the Israeli occupation of our land we respect the Jewish religion we respect the Jewish religion fully it is a monotheistic religion and we respected just as we respect other religions and we condemn in this regard the disaster that befell the Jewish people during World War Two in Europe the Holocaust and we view it as one of the most heinous crimes that was perpetrated against humanity a historic reconciliation between the Palestinians and the Israelis requires that Israel acknowledges its responsibility for the Nakba the Nakba that was inflicted on our Palestinian people and is still being inflicted to this very day this will open a new era of coexistence and will serve to build bridges rather than walls I believe that the Arab Peace Initiative presents reasonable innovative solution yet Israel continues to insist on being selective picking and choosing from this initiative such as the establishment of relations with the Arab countries first without ending its occupation of Palestinian and Arab lands first this is definitely a recipe for more conflict in our region we will not accept this and no one else will the Arab Peace Initiative should be implemented in full from A to Z and Israel must understand that mr. president ladies and gentlemen by the end of this year 100 years would have passed since the Balfour Declaration 70 years since an Nakba of the Palestinian people and 50 years since Israel occupied the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip yes 100 years have passed since the notorious Balfour Declaration the infamous Balfour Declaration by which Britain Great Britain gave without any write authority or consent from anyone the land of Palestine to other people this paved the way for the Nakba of Palestinian people their dispossession their displacement from their land and as if this were not enough the British Mandate interpreted this declaration into policies and measures that contributed to the perpetration of the most heinous crimes against a peaceful people in their own land a people that never attacked anyone or / took in a war against someone therefore we ask Great Britain as we approach 100 years since this infamous declaration to draw the necessary lessons and to bear its historic legal political material and moral responsibility for the consequences of this declaration including an apology to the Palestinian people for the catastrophes misery and injustice this declaration created and to act to rectify these these disasters and remedy its consequences including by the recognition of the State of Palestine this is the least Great Britain can do in addition Israel since 1948 has persisted in its content contempt for international legitimacy by violating United Nations General Assembly resolution 181 to the partition resolution which called for the establishment of two states on the historic land of Palestine according to a specific partition plan Israel for Israeli forces seized more land than those allotted to it and this constituted a grave breach of articles 39 41 and 42 of the United Nations Charter in the preamble of resolution 181 to the partition resolution in paragraph C of the preamble it is stated and I quote the Security Council determined as a threat to the peace breach of the peace or act of aggression in accordance with article 39 of the Charter any attempt to alter by force the settlement envisioned visited by this resolution regrettably however the Security Council is not upholding its responsibilities to hold Israel accountable for its Caeser of the territory allotted to the Palestinian state over half of the Palestinian territory was overtaken by Israel again it is not upholding its responsibility to hold Israel accountable for its seizure of the territory allotted to the Palestinian state according to the partition resolution I appealed to you ladies and gentlemen to read this resolution again mr. president ladies and gentlemen we continue our efforts to build the foundations of a culture of peace among our people we stand firmly against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations we condemn it regardless of its source our region is a victim a prime victim of terrorism and it has endured its wrath over many years we support the unity of people and the territorial integrity as well as political solutions for all of the conflicts in Syria Libya Iraq and elsewhere we also support the efforts of the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to strengthen the foundations of legitimacy in Yemen we support the efforts deployed to overcome terrorism extremism secularism and violence I appeal to you to stand united against terrorism which knows no religion terrorism knows no religion in this context I wish to reaffirm that there is no way to defeat terrorism and extremism no way to achieve security and stability in our region without ending the Israeli occupation of Palestine and ensuring the freedom and independence of the Palestinian people so fighting terrorism and extremism begins when we end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and as such terrorism will end mr. president ladies and gentlemen we continue our genuine and dedicated efforts to achieve Palestinian reconciliation with the formation of a national unity government in accordance with the political reform of the PLO and the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections we are committed to reconstruction in Gaza to alleviate the hardship of our people and to lift the illegal blockade imposed on our people mr. president we extend our hands to those who want to build peace but the question remains and persists is there any leadership in Israel the occupying power that desires to make a true peace is there any leadership that will abandon the mentality of hegemony expansionism and colonialism that will recognize the rights of our people and will end the historical injustice inflicted upon them it is Israel's breach of the agreements it had signed and its failure to comply with the obligations that have led us to the deadlock and stalemate we remain in now the state of Palestine an observer state in the United Nations is a state under occupation 138 countries supported the state of Palestine to become an ass an observer state in the United Nations the Executive Committee of the PLO the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people wherever they may be acts on behalf of our people as their government and the Palestine National Council is the Parliament of the state of Palestine which is in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolution 67 / 19 which was should on the 29th of November 2012 we rely on the international community we haven't lost hope yet we rely on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities we call on those countries that have heard the rights of our people to rectify this injustice moreover we appeal to countries that have not recognized the state of Palestine to do so because those who believe in the two-state solution and everyone speaks about the two-state solution should recognize both states and not just one of them mr. president ladies and gentlemen in this 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly I call on you to declare 2017 as the International Year to end the Israeli occupation of our land and our people in June 2017 half a century of this abhorrent Israeli occupation would have passed I also appeal to you in follow-up to resolution 67 / 19 with the adoption of the resolution to enable Israel to present and co-sponsor resolutions beyond the question of Palestine I call on you to support our efforts to enhance palestine's legal and political status by granting it additional responsibilities to chair committees and international groups as we continue our efforts thanks to your support for full membership in international organizations to be granted full membership in international organizations based on the above the international community is called is called upon now more than ever to exert all efforts to bring an end to the Israeli occupation of the land of the state of Palestine as you know this is the longest and last occupation in contemporary history the international community's ability to advance the rights of our people to ensure their exercise of those very same rights and to end the oppression and injustice imposed on our people for seven decades would surely be a unique opportunity for peace stability and coexistence in our region and between the Palestinian and Israeli

God's blessing be upon you all thank you when the Israeli Prime Minister spoke to the UN there was one thing he hardly talked about the Palestinians he instead focused on Iran claiming Israel had discovered a new nuclear storage facility in Tehran he then went on to boast about the strength of his relationship with the trump administration so I want to use this opportunity to express Israel's appreciation to President Trump and ambassador Haley for the unwavering support they've provided Israel at the United Nations the Palestinian President gave his message the moment he took to the podium and good place at little mayor Jerusalem is not for sale I hope Walker's Sharman and the Palestinian people's rights are not up for bargaining he went on to express his frustration at the actions of the Trump administration we awaited his peace initiative without most patients but we were shocked by decisions and actions he undertook that completely contradict the role and commitment of the US towards the peace process it is ironic that the American administration still talks about what they call the deal of the century the Palestinians believe that by his actions it's not just that President Trump is not an honest broker he's actively on Israel's side and when you listen to the way at a news conference before he left New York he described the man he's put in charge of peace efforts his own son-in-law Jared Kushner it's not hard to see why I think the two-state will happen I think we're going to go down the two-state road and I'm glad I got it out and Jared who's so involved he loves Israel he loves Israel but he's also going to be very fair with the Palestinians he understands it takes two people to be happy to groups of people to be happy everybody's got to be happy and that's why it's so tough the fact he barely mentioned the Palestinians I think shows the confidence of Benjamin Netanyahu in what's going to come out of the Jared Kushner peace plan which were being told we filled in the next four months the Palestinians meanwhile already I think believe they're going to have to reject what's in that plan James BAE's al Jazeera at the United Nations a

another challenge to Israel our Dogon forcefully put his weight behind the Palestinian bid for statehood which is expected to be presented to the United Nations later this month recognizing a Palestinian state is not an option it's an obligation before the end of the CA we will see Palestine are the United Nations in a very different situation God with a clear boost by the regional heavyweight but who's urging of Arab states to respect human rights was more muted the fight against armed groups unites Arab leaders heads of states have reiterated the need to defeat ISIL and al Qaeda and their affiliates which they consider to be a threat in the region what the higher victims of terrorism are mostly Muslims therefore we need to set up cooperation to tackle this threat through a comprehensive approach it's been almost 15 years since the Arab Peace Initiative was launched which called for normalization of relations with Israel in exchange for his forces pulling out from areas they occupied in 1967 but nothing has changed establishing a Palestinian state is still a distant hope and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has warned Israel against building more illegal settlements if Israel wants to be a peace partner in the region and live in peace with its neighbors it must stop believing that security Intel's grabbing more land Israel must stop its occupation the war in Syria was also top of the agenda the Emir of Qatar has called for an immediate cessation of fighting a staunch supporter of the opposition Qatar insist Assad must go and inherit carry fetish engine the catastrophe inflicted on the Syrian people depends on implementing international resolutions many Arab countries blame Iran for financing various groups in Syria and Yemen concerns that explains the repeated reference by Arab dignitaries to what they say is foreign intervention foreign meddling into our affairs is a violation of international law which calls for the respect of sovereignty and good neighborliness the UN chief Antonio Guterres delivered an impassioned speech asking the Arab leaders to choose the path of reconciliation to many populist political leaders have fallen into the trap of presenting the despicable acts of - and al-qaeda driven by Islam when in fact they utterly defy the face indeed Muslims themselves are the primary victims after a day of speeches followed by a final statement it was time for farewells the next summit will be held next year until then the problems in the region will likely continue for almost 70 years of its existence the Arab League has suffered from an image problem for millions of people as long as Arab leaders remain divided on a variety of issues the chances for them to take ownership for the region's most pressing challenges and fixing them are unlikely to happen in the near future hashable al Jazeera the Dead Sea in Jordan
